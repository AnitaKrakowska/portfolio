## About me ##
My name is Anita Krakowska. My expertise lies in the analysis of taxpayers at the tax office. Delving into financial data and ensuring compliance with regulations have become second nature to me. But, deep down, I harbor a hidden passion that I can no longer ignore. Software testing has always intrigued me. I've always loved technology, and the idea of ensuring software products work flawlessly excites me to no end. I want to be the one who ensures users have the best possible experience with the software they use.
Lately, I've been spending my evenings exploring the fascinating world of software testing.
