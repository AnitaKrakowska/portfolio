## About me ##
My name is Anita Krakowska. My expertise lies in the analysis of taxpayers at the tax office. Delving into financial data and ensuring compliance with regulations have become second nature to me. But, deep down, I harbor a hidden passion that I can no longer ignore. Software testing has always intrigued me. I've always loved technology, and the idea of ensuring software products work flawlessly excites me to no end. I want to be the one who ensures users have the best possible experience with the software they use.
Lately, I've been spending my evenings exploring the fascinating world of software development and quality assurance. I've taken up online courses and self-study to learn various testing methodologies and automation tools. I've even started to write some code to get a feel for the technical side of things. In the future, I see myself thriving as a successful software tester, making a real impact on the development of innovative software solutions. I want to be part of a team that crafts exceptional products and enhances the lives of countless users. So, here's to chasing dreams, to embracing new adventures, and to never giving up on the things that ignite our passion. I'm excited about this path I've chosen, and I can't wait to see where it leads me. With determination and an open mind, I know I can make my dream a reality.
